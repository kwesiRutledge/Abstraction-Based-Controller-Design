# Abstraction-Based-Controller-Design - Testing

This directory contains the test suite used to verify the behavior of the repository. Feel free to use this test suite to verify if your code has been properly installed.

Per MATLAB's runtests() command one can run the following command:

	runtests

to run all of the tests in this directory. Or, from this directory one can run a specific test (e.g. test_SystemTuple.m) by writing:

	runtests('test_SystemTuple')
